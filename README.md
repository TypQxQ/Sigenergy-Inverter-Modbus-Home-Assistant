# !!! This is a work in progress !!!
modbus_sigenergy.yaml works but not all values are shifted yet so the decimal point might be wrong.
Will post more after testing.

An *easy-to-use YAML-based integration* for Sigenergy inverters, battery and DC charger for Home Assistant.

## 5. Tested configurations
I have a **Sigenergy SigenStor EC 15.0 TP** Inverter and **2 8kWh batteries** updating frequently to the latest **Home Assistant** (> 2023.3). I try to thoroughly test features before releasing them, but I cannot test everything (e.g., backup capabilities, DO-related, ...)

The Modbus register mapping is based on two documents I found online. I am not sure if I am allowed to share the files, but you can search for them using their names. 
Let me know in the github discussions, if there are newer versions available.

```
Sigenergy Modbus Protocol
Version: V1.7
Release date: 2024-04-09

```

## 6. Status and future work 
1. ReadOnly parameters are read.
2. 


## 7. Contribution
We are happy to share our experiences - feel encouraged to share yours with us, too! 

If you have any questions, feature requests, found any bugs or have some hints how to update the documentation, just ask on Github Discutions.

**Thanks to all the people, who are actively contributing to this project! Special thanks to @mkaiser for the Sungrow integration on wich this is based**
